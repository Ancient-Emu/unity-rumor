Rumor
=====
Rumor is a free, open source narrative content framework meant to be integrated
into any Unity3D game that needs a dialog system. The purpose is to provide an
easy to use framework that is easy for writers to script, be simple for
developers to integrate, and not pretend to know how the user wants to display
the dialog.

This library is a good fit for teams that need a dialog system in their game,
want a scripting language for writers to use, and need an engine for running
the dialog. This library does not and will not contain any rendering
capabilities.

You can download official releases at the [releases page](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-rumor/releases).
