Rumor
=====
Rumor is a free, open source narrative content framework meant to be integrated
into any Unity3D game that needs a dialog system. This library is a good fit
for teams that want a scripting language for writers to use and need an
easy-to-use API for running the dialog. This library does not and will not
contain any rendering capabilities.

You can download official releases at the [releases page](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-rumor/releases).
